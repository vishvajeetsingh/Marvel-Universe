# Marvel-Universe
Marvel is in the process of creating a sweeping fictional universe created out of a multi-decade set of franchises of movies and buttressed with TV series. This fictional universe is called the Marvel Cinematic Universe. By having a coherent universe, you can develop depth in characters and context for decisions across multiple vantage points. This also means that you don’t need to spend a lot of time doing backstories or origin stories. They are now introducing characters in other films before their stand-alone franchises, which means that there is a quicker entry into the main movie. One additional cool point is that the movies are occurring in real-time — meaning that if it has been one year since the last movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, one year will have elapsed in the script. This strategy makes the movies seem fresh.
